Hello! 

Welcome to my PJAS 2016 project! I made this between December 2016 and February 2017. 
To use this program, open up command prompt or some equivilent. Use the cd command to go to the folder in which the file is. Make sure all supporting files found on the Github page are also in this folder. Type "java -jar [PROJECT].jar". The program will then run without any further need for input. 
The program will export the file test.txt, which is where the main data is collected. The format is a description of what the values are, followed by a series of rows of text. Each row represents a round, and each column represents a company. As more companies get added, more columns are added, however within each column these values stay the same. The files MonopolyOn.xlsx and MonopolyOff.xlsx contain the data and some graphs. The file Combine.xlsx contains 10 trials' worth of data  about the revenue of each company, which was used in the presentation. The presentation can be found on PJAS2016.pptx, which explains what the program did in greater detail. 

Thank you for taking the time to review my programs I made while in high school for no direct benefit.
